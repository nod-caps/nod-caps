      <h1>Starting with the original collection</h1>
      <p>We chose to start simple, we wish that we could go out and manufacture 20 different styles of dad caps, baseball caps, unstructured caps, cotten caps, cord caps.. I could go on. However as we are a small team we are choosing to build up to that stage! (aka couldn't afford to go all out)</p>
        <p> Hopefully starting with this small but great collection of dad caps we can get the ball rolling and can offer you plenty more designs down the road.</p>
