<h3><strong>Packaging Details</strong></h3>
<p>We package each cap like it's a gift - everything is carefully packaged up by us and sent to you from Edinburgh. 
  Our caps arrive with no receipts/invoices so you can send it straight to your friends and family! 
  We also try to use environmentally friendly packing and try to use as little packaging as possible (whilst making sure your cap is well protected and still arrives in pristine condition!)
