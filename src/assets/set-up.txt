NOD CAPS SET UP

I am using old versions of angular, node and ionic. So they all need to be on the write versions

Angular CLI: 12.1.4
npm install --save-dev @angular/cli@12.1.4
npx ng --version as it is local

Node: 14.21.3 
This is the a node version that is compatible with this version of angular. So i must nvm use 14 in order to use this
Any later versions wont work with this version of ionic and angular

Ionic: 5.4.16
I have installed this locally in /nod-caps using npm install ionic@5 
The newer set up is different and installs CLI
Npx ionic version to check
You must use npx ionic serve as it is local not global

You must make sure all versions of the above are correct, only then can you run 

Ionic serve
Ng serve etc. 
Check instructions.txt in the folder for putting live
